MAJOR NOTE FOR WINDOWS USER: on Windows system you should use doubles-quotes ("[...]") instead of singles-quotes ('[...]'), for example instead of search.py -p 'C:/directory/' please use  search.py -p "C:/directory/".

    -p, --path=PATH
            The path to search duplicates files.
            Usage examples:
                * -p "~/music"
                * --path="/usr/share/"

    -r, --result=PATH
            The file path where write the results displayed if you want save it.
            Usage examples:
                * -r "~/logs/search_results.txt"
                * result="./results.log"

    --no-estimation:
            If you don't want an estimation before proceed. The estimation display the total files and the current size of directory (recursively) and allow a progress bar.

    -b, --binary:
            If you want an estimation in binary mode (KiB, MiB, GiB, etc.) instead of the default in decimal (KB, MB, GB, etc.).


FEW EXAMPLES:
    * I would like search duplicates into '~/music' with an estimation and in binary mode without writing the output result. I can use:
        search.py -p "~/music" --binary

    * I'm a Windows user, I would like search into 'C:\Documents and Settings\user' and write the output result in 'C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop\results.txt' and I want an estimation. I use:
        search.py --path="C:\Documents and Settings\user" -r "C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop\results.txt" --no-estimation
